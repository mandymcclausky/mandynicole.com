					<p>Bios are always so tacky to write, but I love reading them so I'm just gonna go for it.

					<p>At 8 years old, I became infatuated with our family's first PC running Windows 3.11. I found myself writing stories exponentially more than I already was, designing layouts for fake newspapers, and making wallpapers with Ace of Base lyrics. Having already been an avid console gamer, I also spent an unhealthy amount of time playing both educational &amp; entertainment-based titles.

					<p>At 14 I bought a game that unexpectedly changed the way I viewed the possibilities and future expectations of the web, all thanks to an Active-X plugin that allowed players to upload a proprietary filetype to be interacted with by the internet-at-large. Backed by a powerful community of young, ambitious &mdash; and mostly-female &mdash; artists, designers, developers, and hackers that motivated and inspired me immensely, I began getting into web development and hex-editing.

					<p>In becoming frustrated with trying to teach myself  JavaScript, I quickly learned to love the <del>relative ease of</del> complexities involved in the design aspect instead. From there, I created multiple sites with other members of the community before landing my first full-time web gig at 16.

					<p class="divider"><i class="icon">&#9206;</i></p>

					<p>After a decade of working at various agencies in southeastern Washington, I moved to Portland to further my career and live in a city I'd always adored. Over these last few years I was the sole designer for an in-house development team working on web-based applications for the events industry. 

					<p>In May of 2013, my boyfriend and I (along with a few of our wonderful friends) bought a skatepark with retail space and enough room in the back for a small design studio. I'm currently freelancing while handling all of the web-oriented aspects of the business, but I thrive best in teams and care a lot about my personal growth as both a designer and developer, so <a href="#contact">I'd love to talk</a> if you think I may be a good fit for your project and/or team.
